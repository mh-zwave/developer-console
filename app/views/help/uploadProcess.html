            Before uploading you have to pack your Module as an "tar.gz" file.
            <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
                Danger: only pack the Content of the Module folder not the Module Folder itself.
            </div>
            for Example in Unix u can use this commands.
            <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                cd /opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules/#yourmodule#

                The first step before you are able to upload your first own module is to pack them correct.
                At the moment we only support the filetype "tar.gz". Make sure that you use this filetype.
                If you have finished your module and packed them correct then you can start uploading on the main-screen
                of our developer-center
                and click "Add new module" and follow the instrutctions.
                Was your upload successful then you should see your module in your overview with all the correct values
                like
                "Title", "Icon", "Category", "Version", "Maturity"
                and the last-updated-timestamp.

                Before your apps is fully integrated in our app-store you need to verify them (read more on
                "Verification - Process").
                That means the we prove your applikation and test them.
                This cost some time and maybe you donÂ´t want to wait or want that your friends oder co-workers are also
                able to test them.
                In this case you can define your own "token" in your module-management. You only need to click on edit
                (at the right side on your module-overview) and add your own token.
                Then you can share them like you want and everyone which have these token can download the application
                in his software.

                The verification-process can startet by a click on "Send a request" in your module-overview. Now is your
                verification in process.
                You got a mail from us if we accept or decline your module. In that case if we decline you also got a
                reason from us and can fix/change them and start the verification again.
                After a successful verification everyone can access your module in our app-store.
