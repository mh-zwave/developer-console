                The Z-Way Server offers a connection between the Z-Wave-wireless-protocol and users. The hardware independent server-Software is mostly developed in JavaScript.

                The Z-Way home automation Software consists out of 3 parts:<br>
            <li>User-Interface</li>
            <li>JSON-API (or HTTP-API)</li>
            <li>JavaScript Server</li>
            <br>
            <p align="justify">
                The Z-Way Z-Wave core is linking the Z-Wave transceiver and the Z-Wave device API with the Z-Way JavaScript core, this is a condition a to communicate with Z-Wave compatible hardware. Depending on this the Z-Wave device API delivers a HTTP-Interface, which is used by the Expert UI. The Expert UI is required to include devices and adjust their parameters, that means to manipulate the devices directly. There is also an C-Library with the same functionality.
            </p>       <p align="justify">
                But the until now described components are not offering any kind of automation. There is also an Z-Way JavaScript core who extends the Z-Way device API. There is the place to define modules to realize automation. There are some modules already pre-installed at the system. A module consists always out of the same parts, a description of the interface and the JavaScript logic (see. 
                <a href=# ng-click="$parent.$parent.setActive(2)">structure</a>).
            </p>       <p align="justify">               
                At the module continuum Z-Way takes another step of abstraction for the devices. For example, a multifunctional sensor with 3 functions, is mapped to 3 different virtual devices. 
            </p>       <p align="justify">
                The virtual devices can only be one of the 5 different types:
            </p>
            <br>
            <li>        Binary Sensor</li>
            <li> 	Multilevel Sensor</li>
            <li>	Binary Switch</li>
            <li>	Multilevel Switch</li>
            <li>	Thermostat</li>
            <br>
            The Smart Home UI offers a graphical interface, who allows to instantiate and configure the modules.  Because of the abstraction with JavaScript it is possible, with the accordingly 3rd party core,to use other wireless-protocols beside Z-Wave documented Z-Wave.
